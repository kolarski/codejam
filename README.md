> Here are some correct solutions to some of the problems of Google Code Jam.

> They are quite optimized for speed & working with large datasets, so they probably are not really readable =)

* **Round 1A 2010 / A / Rotate** - [Problem] [1]
  *  I came up with pretty fast solution using string manipulations (Under 1 sec with large dataset), really it is not necessary because we have the limitation of N < 50, but it is just practice =)
* **Qualification Round Africa 2010 / B / Reverse Words** - [Problem] [2] 
  * I was shocked by this problem :D
* **Qualification Round Africa 2010 / А / Store Credit** - [Problem] [3] 
  * Quite easy one .. This qualification round was funny :P
